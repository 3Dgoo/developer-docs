# Silverstripe CMS GraphQL server

GraphQL can be used as a content API layer for Silverstripe CMS to get data in and out of the content management system.

> [!CAUTION]
> GraphQL is being removed from the admin section in CMS 6.0, so any customisations made
> to the `admin` schema will no longer work.
> GraphQL will still be available as an optional module in CMS 6.0 and still be used to create frontend schemas i.e. the `default` schema.

For more information on GraphQL in general, visit its [documentation site](https://graphql.org).
