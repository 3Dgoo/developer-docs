# Forms

The [`Form`](api:SilverStripe\Forms\Form) class provides a way to create interactive forms in your web application with very little effort.
Silverstripe CMS handles generating the correct semantic HTML markup for the form and each of the fields, as well as the
framework for dealing with submissions and validation.
