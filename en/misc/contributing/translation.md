## Contributing Translations for the User Interface

[Â« Back to Contributing page](../contributing)

The content for UI elements (button labels, field titles) and instruction texts shown in the CMS and
elsewhere is stored in the PHP code for a module (see [i18n](/topics/i18n)). 
All content can be extracted as a "language file", and uploaded to an online translation editor interface.
SilverStripe is already translated in over 60 languages, and we're relying on native speakers
to keep these up to date, and of course add new languages. 
Please [register](translation-process) a free translator account to get started, 
even if you just feel like fixing up a few sentences.
See [our translation workflow](translation-process) for more details.
