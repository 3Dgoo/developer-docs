# 3.0.10

## Overview

 * Security: Partially cached content from stage or other reading modes is no longer emitted to live

## Upgrading

 * If relying on partial caching of content between logged in users, be aware that the cache is now automatically
   segmented based on both the current member ID, and the versioned reading mode. If this is not an appropriate
   method (such as if the same content is served to logged in users within partial caching) then it is necessary
   to adjust the config value of `SSViewer::global_key` to something more or less sensitive.
