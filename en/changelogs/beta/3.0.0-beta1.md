# 3.0.0-beta1 #

## Overview ##

### CMS ###
 
 * The "Files & Images" (`AssetAdmin`) interface shows the file tree next to a flat list.
   It lists images as thumbnails, and allows to search by file category.
 * The CMS editor can insert multiple images as once, finds them more efficiently,
   and shows better previews on what's being inserted. 
 * More extensible architecture for inserting media types other than images or flash objects.
 * All interfaces expose their currently managed content structure as linked breadcrumbs,
   aiding navigation and clarifying content hierachies of e.g. Pages or Group->Member relationships.
 * Removed prototype.js/behaviour.js usage from nearly all core interfaces
 
### Framework ###

 * New `Config` API to standardise configuration contained in objects (early stage)
 * New `GridField` API to replace `TableListField` and `ComplexTableField`.
   More decoupled architecture, using the new ORM.
 * A `GridFieldDetailForm` interface allows editing of master/detail relationships,
   including traversing nested relationships (which wasn't possible before due to popup-in-a-popup problem).
   Detail forms fully support the TinyMCE editor, as they're loaded into the main CMS interface rather than a popup.
 * Redesigned `ModelAdmin` interface building on top of `GridField`.
   Search results show by default, clearer layout of interfaces managing multiple classes.
 * Interfaces like `ModelAdmin` can make use of TinyMCE, including insertion of images and links.
 * New `UploadField` API to replace `ImageField` and `FileIframeField`.
   Allows for multiple file uploads through HTML5 (with fallbacks),
   inline editing of file properties after upload, and management of has_many/many_many file relationships.
 * The "Users' (`SecurityAdmin`) interface manages groups in a list rather than a tree,
   and uses `GridField` to list users/groups/roles. Adding members to groups is now possible
   with standard `GridField` autocomplete components. Roles and groups are assigned
   via an inline autocomplete field, which is quicker and smaller than a dedicated table field.
 * Overloadable templates for most form fields. `FormField->setAttribute()` to enable HTML5 attributes

## TODO ##

A non-exhaustive, high-level list of features we havenâ€™t addressed yet:
 
 * List view for pages
 * Gallery view for files
 * In-content file upload (and "insert from web")
 * Widget editing in CMS (most likely separated into a module)
 * New batch action system with interactive dialogs
 * ReportAdmin
 * Configurable two-level CMS menu
 * SQL Server and PostgreSQL core support
 * Performance fixes for Internet Explorer
 
## Upgrading ##

See [3.0.0](/changelogs/3.0.0) for previous details.
Note that you'll get PHP notice-level errors automatically
when using deprecated functionality (through the new `Deprecation` class).
