# 3.0.4

## Overview

 * Security: Information leakage through web access on YAML configuration files
 * Security: Information leakage through web access on composer files
 * Security: Require ADMIN permissions for `?showtemplate=1`
 * Changed `dev/tests/setdb` and `dev/tests/startsession` from session to cookie storage.

## Details

### Security: Prevent web access to YAML and composer files

Severity: Moderate

Description: YAML files are used to configure the SilverStripe application
since its 3.0 release. These files can contain sensitive values such as database
and API credentials. By default, the installer still stores database credentials
in `_config.php` files which are safe from web access. So this only concerns
configuration values added in your own project, or a third party module.

Resolution: Update your `.htaccess` file (for Apache), or your `web.config` file (for IIS)
with the new files from the project root, and reapply any customizations you've made.
Follow the [general upgrade instructions](/installation/upgrading).
The [nginx installation instructions](/installation/nginx)
have also been updated to reflect those changes.

### Security: Information exposure through web access on composer files

Severity: Low

Description: [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) is a dependency management
tool which can optionally be used to install SilverStripe. The `composer.json`
and `composer.lock` files are required for its operation, so they are included 
in the standard release since 3.0.2. These files contain information on the installed
versions of core and thirdparty modules, which could be used to target specific
versions of SilverStripe.

Resolution: Update your `.htaccess` file (for Apache), or your `web.config` file (for IIS)
with the new files from the project root, and reapply any customizations you've made.
Follow the [general upgrade instructions](/installation/upgrading).
The [nginx installation instructions](/installation/nginx)
have also been updated to reflect those changes.


### Security: Require ADMIN permissions for `?showtemplate=1`

Severity: Low

Description: Avoids information leakage of compiled template data,
which might expose some of the internal template logic.

## Upgrading

 * If you are using `dev/tests/setdb` and `dev/tests/startsession`,
   you'll need to configure a secure token in order to encrypt the cookie value:
   Simply run `sake dev/generatesecuretoken` and add the resulting code to your `mysite/_config.php`.
   Note that this functionality now requires the PHP `mcrypt` extension.
