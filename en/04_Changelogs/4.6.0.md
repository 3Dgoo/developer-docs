## MySQL tables are auto-converted from MyISAM to InnoDB {#myisam}

Beginning with [4.4.0](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/changelogs/4.4.0/),
our minimum requirement for MySQL is 5.6 (since MySQL 5.5 end of life reached in December 2018).
Starting with MySQL 5.6, [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-introduction.html)
is the new default storage engine,
replacing the older [MyISAM](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/myisam-storage-engine.html) engine.

Silverstripe CMS already creates InnoDB tables by default,
mainly in order to benefit from their better support for database transactions.
Before MySQL 5.6, InnoDB didn't have a `FULLTEXT` search index,
requiring us to enforce the MyISAM engine when devs opted into this index type
in their particular setup. There are a few ways in which this opt-in can happen:

 * Adding the [FulltextSearchable](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/blob/4/src/ORM/Search/FulltextSearchable.php)
   extension to a DataObject, as described in our 
   [search docs](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/search/fulltextsearch/)
 * Defining `'type' => 'fulltext'` in `DataObject::$db` column definitions
 * Implementing [DBIndexable](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/blob/4/src/ORM/FieldType/DBIndexable.php)
   on a custom `DBField` subclass.
 * Setting `'ENGINE=MyISAM'` in `DataObject::$create_table_options`
 
This search index is not required to enable simple text search
in the "Pages" section of the CMS, or any ModelAdmin implementations.
We generally recommend to choose a more powerful
[search addon](https://addons.silverstripe.org/add-ons?search=fulltext&type=&sort=downloads)
(e.g. based on Solr or ElasticSearch) for website frontend search use cases. 

As of 4.6.0, a `dev/build` will automatically switch MyISAM tables to InnoDB,
which automatically recreates any indexes required. If you have large indexes,
this can extend the duration if this task. As usual, back up your database
before upgrading, and test upgrades on non-production systems first.
Our tests indicate that indexes with thousands of records and screen pages
worth of content (15MB index size) are converted in a few seconds. 

In order to opt out of this change, you can set the engine explicitly
for your DataObject implementations:

```php
use SilverStripe\ORM\Connect\MySQLSchemaManager;
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;

class MyDataObject extends DataObject
{
    private static $create_table_options = [
            MySQLSchemaManager::ID => 'ENGINE=MyISAM'
    ];
}
```
