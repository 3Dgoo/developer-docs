# 4.0.5

## Notable changes

Fix [#7971](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/pull/7971) introduces a subtle change of behaviour
to how `Config` settings are prioritised. In SilverStripe 4 there was a change where `Extension` objects took the
highest importance when determining Config values; this was deemed to be unexpected and unintuitive as well as making it
cumbersome and difficult for developers to override module defaults defined in `Extension`s. This change reverts
behaviour to that of SilverStripe 3 where `Extension` instances are of lowest importance and are used only to set a
default value. If you rely on your `Extension` or module providing an overriding config value, please move this to yaml.
