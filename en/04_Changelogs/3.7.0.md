# 3.7.0 (unreleased)

## SilverStripe 3.7 and PHP 7.2 and Object subclasses

### For Project Code

SilverStripe 3.7 now supports PHP 7.2, which is exciting, but PHP 7.2 introduces an `object` keyword.
To use it, you can replace any uses of `Object` with `SS_Object` in your own project code.

```diff
-class MyClass extends Object
+class MyClass extends SS_Object
{
	public function myFunction()
	{
-		$foo = Object::has_extension('MyExtension');
+		$foo = SS_Object::has_extension('MyExtension');
	}
}
```

You are also reliant on any SilverStripe modules directly using `Object` to upgrade their codebase.
Matches for `SS_Object` in the module codebase will tell you it's been upgraded.
A search for `extends Object` or `Object::` isn't fool proof, but will give you an indication
that the module still needs to be upgraded. If in doubt, check the module README.

### For Module Authors

If you are publishing a 3.x-compatible module that directly references the `Object` class,
we recommend that you replace all references to `Object` with `SS_Object`,
and add the following line to your module's `_config.php`
in order to support both current SilverStripe 3.x and SilverStripe 3.7 releases running on PHP 7.2:

```php
// Ensure compatibility with PHP 7.2 ("object" is a reserved word),
// with SilverStripe 3.6 (using Object) and SilverStripe 3.7 (using SS_Object)
if (!class_exists('SS_Object')) class_alias('Object', 'SS_Object');
```

Don't forget to mention explicit PHP 7.2 and SilverStripe 3.7 compatibility in your module README.

Note that in SilverStripe 4.x, the `Object` class was deleted so there isnâ€™t an `SS_Object` class there either
