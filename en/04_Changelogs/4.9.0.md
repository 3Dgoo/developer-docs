## Features and enhancements {#features-and-enhancements}

### Image lazy loading {#image-lazy-loading}

Silverstripe CMS now lazy loads most images by default and includes some options to opt-out of this behaviour.

Image lazy loading defers the loading of images not in the viewport to improve the initial page load performance. 
Read more about (image lazy-loading)[https://web.dev/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/].

This feature was implemented in partnership with Google.

Most images will now get the `loading="lazy"` attribute added to them.  This includes:
- images added via the HTML Editor's **insert media** button
- image DataObjects added to templates

Image HTML tags (`<img>`) added in templates will not be lazy loaded by default.

To disable lazy loading for an individual image in a template, use `$MyImage.LazyLoad(false)`.

There's some scenarios where you might not want to use the native Silverstripe CMS lazy loading. For example, you might already have a custom lazy loading implementation.

To opt out of lazy loading globally, use the following yml config:

```yml
SilverStripe\Assets\Image:
  lazy_loading_enabled: false
```

#### CMS authors

CMS authors can disable lazy loading on images added via the WYSIWYG editor in the "Edit image" panel by setting the new "Loading" field to "Eager".

### Other new features

* [Dot notation support in form fields](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/pull/9192): Save directly into nested has_one relationships (see [docs](/developer_guides/forms/how_tos/handle_nested_data)).
