## Features and enhancements {#features-and-enhancements}

### Image lazy loading {#image-lazy-loading}

Silverstripe CMS now lazy loads most images by default and includes some options to opt-out of this behaviour.

Image lazy loading defers the loading of images not in the viewport to improve the initial page load performance. 
Read more about (image lazy-loading)[https://web.dev/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/].

This feature was implemented in partnership with Google.

Most images will now get the `loading="lazy"` attribute added to them.  This includes:
- images added via the HTML Editor's **insert media** button
- image DataObjects added to templates

Image HTML tags (`<img>`) added in templates will not be lazy loaded by default.

To disable lazy loading for an individual image in a template, use `$MyImage.LazyLoad(false)`.

There's some scenarios where you might not want to use the native Silverstripe CMS lazy loading. For example, you might already have a custom lazy loading implementation.

To opt out of lazy loading globally, use the following yml config:

```yml
SilverStripe\Assets\Image:
  lazy_loading_enabled: false
```

#### CMS authors

CMS authors can disable lazy loading on images added via the WYSIWYG editor in the "Edit image" panel by setting the new "Loading" field to "Eager".

### Manage your CMS sessions across devices {#session-manager}

The [session manager module](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-session-manager) is a new security focused feature which allows a CMS user to view and manage their active sessions in the CMS within the "My profile" section of the CMS (/admin/myprofile). They can see the device details behind each session and have the ability to revoke these sessions. This new module has been added to `silverstripe/recipe-cms` which is the recommended method of managing Silverstripe CMS dependencies in a project.

Projects that have `silverstripe/recipe-cms` as a requirement in their `composer.json` will automatically get `silverstripe/session-manager` when you run `composer update`. If your project does not use `silverstripe/recipe-cms`, it's recommended that you require `silverstripe/session-manager` in your composer file as a security enhancement. The session manager module requires no configuration and works out-of-the-box.

If your site has the [symbiote/silverstripe-queuedjobs](https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-queuedjobs) module installed, then a job will automatically be created that will periodically remove old database records created by the session manager module.

CMS users can review the [Session Manager user help](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/4/managing_your_website/session_manager/) for more information on managing their sessions.

### Other new features

* [Dot notation support in form fields](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/pull/9192): Save directly into nested has_one relationships (see [docs](/developer_guides/forms/how_tos/handle_nested_data)).
