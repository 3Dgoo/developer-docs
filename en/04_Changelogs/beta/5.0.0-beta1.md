# Silverstripe CMS 5.0.0-beta1

This is the first beta release for Silverstripe CMS 5. This is a pre-release version of Silverstripe CMS 5. It is not suitable for a production environment.

We are anticipating that we will tag a Silverstripe CMS 5 Release Candidate in March 2023 and a stable release in April 2023.

## About the Beta phase

### Trying the beta

Creating a Silverstripe CMS 5 test project is just as easy as before. Simply run this command to try out the Silverstripe CMS 5 beta.

```
composer create-project silverstripe/installer my-site 5.0.0-beta1
```

## Reporting bugs

If you find a bugs in the beta, report it by [creating an issue against the relevant GitHub repository](https://github.com/silverstripe). Prefix the title of your issue with "CMS5-beta" to make it easier for our development team to identify it.

You can [create the issue against `silverstripe/framework`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues/new) if you are not sure which GitHub repository should host the issue.

### Change freeze

Now that the Silverstripe CMS 5 beta has been tagged, our aim is to:
- make no further breaking API changes to the CMS5 codebase
- have all supported dependencies upgraded to a supported major version.

We recognize that beta testing may bring to our attention bugs or problems that can not be easily remedied without a breaking API change.

We will only consider merging post-beta breaking API changes if they are necessary to address a high impact flaw in the CMS5 code base. Each of those breaking API changes will have to be individually approved by the CMS Squad team lead.

Non-breaking API changes and enhancements may be merged after the initial CMS 5 beta release.

#### Post CMS5 RC freeze
Once the initial CMS5.0 RC is released, non-breaking API changes will no longer be accepted and will have to be targeted to CMS5.1.

Bug fixes may be accepted if they can be solved without changing APIs.

### Known issues

The Silverstripe CMS 5 beta 1 release contains several know issues. We'll aim to address those prior the Silverstripe CMS 5 Release candidate. These likely only the tip of the iceberg.

#### Bugs

- [Yubikey registration fails](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-webauthn-authenticator/issues/124)
- [Fix broken JavaScript tests](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/1421)
- [Clear up errors and warnings when running yarn commands](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/1416)
- [React context no longer has "You have unsaved changes" confirm dialog](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/1409)
- [Cannot delete image in WYSIWYG with delete button](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/1410)
- [Console error whenever a toast pops up](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/1412)

## Upgrading your third party module

One of the primary purposes of the beta testing phase is to give third party maintainers and developers an opportunity to upgrade their modules to be compatible with Silverstripe CMS 5.

### Planning your upgrade

You should decide if you intend to do a new major release of your module to add support for Silverstripe CMS 5.

Most of key Silverstripe CMS APIs have not change between Silverstripe CMS 4 and Silverstripe CMS 5. Take time to read this changelog to identify changes that might be problematic for your project.

Depending on how complex your module is, it may be completely practical to create a version that works with both Silverstripe CMS 4 and Silverstripe CMS 5. We do not necessarily recommend this approach. But you may wish to consider it to minimise your maintenance burden.

If you decide that you want to maintain distinct Silverstripe CMS 4 and Silverstripe CMS 5 versions of your module, then you should fork your current development branch.

[info]
If the name of your branch is a number, composer will allow it to be installed as an unstable tag. e.g.: If your module has a `7` branch, composer will alias the `HEAD` of that branch as `7.x-dev`. This will satisfy a constraint like `^7`.
[/info]

### Stop using deprecated code

A good way to identify which APIs need to be updated is to [enable deprecation warnings](/Upgrading/Deprecations) and run your module against the latest Silverstripe CMS 4 release. This will let you remove any references to deprecated APIs in the Silverstripe CMS 4 version of your module.

If you intend to remove some APIs in the Silverstripe CMS 5 version of your module, consider [adding deprecation warnings](/Contributing/Release_Process#Deprecating-API) to the Silverstripe CMS 4 version. This will simplify the upgrade process for projects using your module.

### Upgrade your constraints

Upgrade your composer requirement constraints to allow the installation of Silverstripe CMS 5 module. If your module has dual support for Silverstripe CMS 4 and 5, you'll want to use constraint similar to:
```json
"require": {
    "silverstripe/framework": "^4 || ^5",
    "silverstripe/cms": "^4 || ^5",
    "silverstripe/admin": "^1 || ^2"
}
```

Otherwise, simply increment your existing constraints to target the Silverstripe CMS 5 version of our modules.

### Ship a Silverstripe CMS 5 version of your module

Obviously, you'll want to test your module against a Silverstripe CMS 5 installation to identify and fix any problems. Once you're confident that your module works well with Silverstripe CMS 5, you'll want to tag a new release.

Consider tagging a beta release if you want to give your users a chance to test drive your module with the Silverstripe CMS 5 beta.
