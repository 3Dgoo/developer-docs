# Silverstripe CMS 5.0.0-beta1

## Post CMS5 beta freeze
One of the primary purposes of the beta testing is to give third party maintainers developers an opportunity to upgrade their modules to be compatible with CMS5. Once the CMS5 beta is tagged, our aim is to:
Make no further breaking API changes will be made to the CMS5 codebase.
Have all supported dependencies upgraded to a supported major.

We recognize that beta testing may bring to our attention bugs or problems that can not be easily remedied without a breaking API change.

We will only consider merging post-beta breaking API changes if they are necessary to address a high impact flaw in the CMS5 code base. Each of those breaking API changes will have to be individually approved by the CMS Squad team lead.

Non-breaking API changes and enhancements may be merged after the initial CMS 5 beta release.

## Post CMS5 RC freeze
Once the initial CMS5.0 RC is released, non-breaking API changes will no longer be accepted and will have to be targeted to CMS5.1.

Bug fixes may be accepted if they can be solved without changing APIs.
