# 4.4.0

## Overview {#overview}

 - [Correct PHP types are now returned from database queries](/developer_guides/model/sql_select#data-types)
 - [Server Requirements](/getting_started/server_requirements/#web-server-software-requirements) have been refined
 - MySQL 5.5 end of life reached in December 2018, thus SilverStripe 4.4 requires MySQL 5.6+.  
   SilverStripe 4.3 and prior still support MySQL 5.5 for their own lifetime.

## Upgrading {#upgrading}

 - dev/build is now non-destructive for all Enums, not just ClassNames. This means your data won't be lost if you're switching between versions, but watch out for code that breaks when it sees an unrecognised value!

## Changes to internal APIs

 - `PDOQuery::__construct()` now has a 2nd argument. If you have subclassed PDOQuery and overridden __construct() 
   you may see an E_STRICT error
