# 3.7.4 (unreleased)

* [Minor update to support PHP 7.4](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/pull/9110)

## Running SilverStripe 3.7 on PHP 7.4

SilverStripe's standard test tools require `phpunit/phpunit-mock-objects` to run. This package has been deprecated and
doesn't support PHP 7.4.

SilverStripe is using a fork for its own PHP 7.3 unit tests: `sminnee/phpunit-mock-objects`.

You can use this fork for your own project by running this command:
```bash
composer require --dev sminnee/phpunit-mock-objects:^3.4.7
```

This fork is not a supported module and SilverStripe does not commit to maintaining it.
