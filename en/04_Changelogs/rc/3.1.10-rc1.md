# 3.1.10-rc1

## Upgrading

### Form Actions

Form action titles are now safely XML encoded, although this was an implicit assumption, it is now explicitly enforced.
XML encoding titles will not cause an error, but is deprecated at framework 4.0. FormAction buttons with custom HTML
content should be assigned using the `FormAction::setButtonContent` method instead.
