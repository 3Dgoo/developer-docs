# 5.0.0-rc1 (unreleased)

#### Post CMS5 RC freeze
Once the initial CMS5.0 RC is released, non-breaking API changes will no longer be accepted and will have to be targeted to CMS5.1.

Bug fixes may be accepted if they can be solved without changing APIs.

#### Post beta changes
- In `silverstripe/staticpublishqueue` the class [`SilverStripe\StaticPublishQueue\Dev\StaticPublisherState`](api:SilverStripe\StaticPublishQueue\Dev\StaticPublisherState) is no longer enabled by default and can benabled via opt-in. There are opt-in instructions in the `README.md` of the module.
