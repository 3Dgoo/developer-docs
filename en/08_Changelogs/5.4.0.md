## Features and enhancements

### Option to change `ClassName` column from enum to varchar {#classname-varchar}

On websites with very large database tables it can take a long time to run `dev/build`, which can be a problem when deploying changes to production. This is because the `ClassName` column is an `enum` type which requires an a `ALTER TABLE` query to be run affecting every row whenever there is a new valid value for the column. For a very rough benchmark, running an `ALTER TABLE` query on a database table of 10 million records took 28.52 seconds on a mid-range 2023 laptop, though this time will vary depending on the database and hardware being used.

This release introduces a new configuration option to change the `ClassName` column to a `varchar` type which removes the need to run `ALTER TABLE` whenever there is a new valid value.

Enabling this will result in a trade-off where the size of the database will increase by approximately 7 MB per 100,000 rows. There will also be a very slow initial `dev/build` as all of the `ClassName` columns are switched to `varchar`. To enable this, add the following configuration:

```yml
SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject:
  fixed_fields:
    ClassName: DBClassNameVarchar

SilverStripe\ORM\FieldType\DBPolymorphicForeignKey:
  composite_db:
    Class: "DBClassNameVarchar('SilverStripe\\ORM\\DataObject', ['index' => false])"
```

### Other new features

- (fill this is as features are added)

## API changes

- The class names for the `TopPage` feature in [`dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-elemental) do not follow the correct naming convention for Silverstripe CMS. The existing classes have been deprecated and will be renamed to match the correct naming convention in a future major release.
